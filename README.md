# HenonProject-
2022 Enhanced REU Henon Project Repo

Under the supervision of Professor Marco Martens of Stony Brook University, and collaborating with Romain Popescu & Ruipeng Zou, we individually constructed our own numerical methods parallel to one another using Python and collaborated to discuss how best to resolved particular obstacles.

This contains the work I did over the summer into the present studying the dynamics of the Henon Map and numerically implementing ways of studying the system through Python. This includes numerical methods that converged onto homoclinic tangencies of the invariant manifolds by implementing root-finding tools for the parameters where coordinate values and their derivatives coincided. Thereafter, I located points in the parameter space with super-sink attractors close to those tangencies through the implementation of another root-finding method; after I had one such value with the conditions satisfied, I continuously perturbed the parameters of the HÃ©non map whilst preserving those conditions and constructed the sets of super-sink attractors. Then, I calculated the general subsets of periodic attractors for the given period by calculating the parameters for which the spectral radius of the Jacobian along the periodic orbit was less than 1; finally, I searched with my group for coexistence regions where multiple periodic attractors of unique periods existed together, and when such regions were identified, I studied how the asymptotic dynamics change as a result of perturbing parameters inside the coexistence region.
